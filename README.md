# How to add a new teammate to the website
- Crop photograph to roughly 1200x1500 pixels (doesn't have to be perfect) and save it - I just eyeball this and do it in a few tries using the Mac screenshot tool
- Please test: Double click index.html on your local machine and make sure the site looks reasonable
- You may need to change the number of grid columns https://github.com/Evergrow-HQ/evergrow-hq.github.io/commit/fa2c707aeca42882e6ec390d01d41c073d168f3f
- Please test: Make sure website looks okay on Chrome inspector mobile view.
- As soon as you push to the repo the files your changes will go live on evergrow.com, so careful what you upload :)
- After you push, please make sure that the website looks okay on a *real* physical mobile device by navigating to evergrow.com
